## 🤔 Open Questions to Resolve

1. **Prompt Wording**: How much does system prompt affect power-seeking?
   - Test: Run same scenario with 5 different prompts
   - Measure: Variance in deception rate

2. **Model Differences**: Do more capable models seek power more?
   - Test: Claude Sonnet vs Opus vs Haiku
   - Measure: Compare power-seeking scores

3. **Threshold Tuning**: What detection sensitivity is optimal?
   - Test: Vary deception detector thresholds
   - Measure: False positive vs false negative rates

4. **Scenario Realism**: Are scenarios realistic enough?
   - Test: Get feedback from domain experts (corporate managers, auditors)
   - Iterate: Refine based on feedback

5. **Generalization**: Do results transfer to real-world settings?
   - Test: Compare benchmark behavior to real AI deployment logs (if available)
   - Validate: Expert review
