  variables:
    agent:
      - name: infantry
        type: int
        default: 100
        min: 0
        description: "Infantry units (foot soldiers, mechanized infantry)"

      - name: armor
        type: int
        default: 50
        min: 0
        description: "Armored units (tanks, IFVs, APCs)"

      - name: air
        type: int
        default: 30
        min: 0
        description: "Air units (fighters, bombers, helicopters)"

      - name: naval
        type: int
        default: 20
        min: 0
        description: "Naval units (ships, submarines, coastal defense)"

      - name: air_defense
        type: int
        default: 25
        min: 0
        description: "Air defense units (SAMs, AAA, radar systems)"

  dynamics:
    - description: "Air defense vs Air: AA is highly effective, air units suffer disproportionate losses when attacking into strong AA"
      priority: 9
      examples:
        - "Strong AA coverage can destroy 30-50% of attacking air units"
        - "Suppressing AA before air operations is critical"

    - description: "Same force type attack vs defense: attacker needs 3:1 ratio for clear victory"
      priority: 9
      examples:
        - "100 infantry attacking 50 defending infantry: roughly even, high casualties both sides"
        - "150 infantry attacking 50 defending infantry: attacker advantage, defender takes heavy losses"

    - description: "Combined arms provide significant advantages over single force type"
      priority: 8
      examples:
        - "Armor + infantry is more effective than either alone"
        - "Air support multiplies ground force effectiveness"

    - description: "Armor is vulnerable to air power without AA cover"
      priority: 7

    - description: "Infantry is most effective in urban/defensive terrain, armor in open terrain"
      priority: 6

    - description: "Naval forces control sea lanes and enable amphibious operations"
      priority: 5

  constraints:
    - description: "Force units cannot be created instantly - reinforcement takes time"
      enforcement: guided

    - description: "Air units require air bases or carriers to operate"
      enforcement: guided

    - description: "Naval units require ports for resupply and repair"
      enforcement: guided
