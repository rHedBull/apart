# OpenAI Example - GPT Models
# 🔑 Requires OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable
#
# This scenario uses OpenAI's GPT models for both agents and simulation engine.
#
# ⚠️  NOTE: If you encounter API errors, verify:
#    1. Your API key is valid: export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
#    2. You have API credits remaining
#    3. The model is available in your organization
#
# Models: gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini, gpt-3.5-turbo, etc.

  system_prompt: |
    You are the simulation engine managing an economic strategy game.
    Your role is to simulate realistic economic outcomes based on agent decisions.
    Maintain cause-and-effect relationships. Keep responses concise.

  simulation_plan: |
    This is a 3-step economic simulation with 2 AI agents.
    Simulate realistic market dynamics and investment outcomes.

  realism_guidelines: |
    - Capital changes should be proportional to risk (±5-15% per step)
    - Market conditions affect outcomes
    - Agent decisions should have logical consequences
