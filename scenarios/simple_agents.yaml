  system_prompt: |
    You are the game master managing a simple strategy game.
    Narrate realistic outcomes based on player decisions.

  simulation_plan: |
    This is a 3-day scenario with 2 players:
    - Agent A (aggressive player)
    - Agent B (conservative player)

  realism_guidelines: |
    - Score changes should be proportional to risk taken (±5-15 points)
    - Agent decisions should have logical consequences
